    <h1 class="abc">hello,my DEAR</h1>

    <p class="lyrics">I cannot live without you <br>
        I told you this is true <br>
        I'll take pieces of you with me <br>
        I'll take parts you never knew <br>
        And one day you will wake up <br>
        Without warning or a clue <br>
        And start to notice little things <br>
        That are missing parts of you <br>
        Oh, I need you here <br>
        Oh, you will always be my dear <br>
        The freckle on your shoulder <br>
        And the creases on your cheeks <br>
        The scar upon your forehead <br>
        And your whisper when you speak <br>
        I took them cause I need you <br>
        I took them to be mine <br>
        I took them so you miss them <br>
        So you'd want them back in time <br>
        Oh, I need you here <br>
        Oh, you will always be my <br>
        Oh, I need you here <br>
        Oh, you will always be my dear <br>
        If I hold on to you <br>
        Don't let me go <br>
        Will you, feel me, need me <br>
        Don't let me go <br>
        If I hold on to you <br>
        Don't let me go <br>
        Will you, feel me, need me <br>
        Don't let me go <br>
        Oh, I need you here <br>
        (Don't let me go, will you, feel me, need me) <br>
        Oh, you will alway be my <br>
        (Don't let me go, if I hold on) <br>
        Oh, I need you here <br>
        (Don't let me go) <br>
        Oh, you will always be my dear <br> <br> <br> <br>
