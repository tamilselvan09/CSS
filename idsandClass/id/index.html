    <h1 id="abc">Hello My Love</h1>
    <p id="cba">An empty street, an empty house <br>
        A hole inside my heart <br>
        I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller <br>
        I wonder how, I wonder why <br>
        I wonder where they are <br>
        The days we had, the songs we sang together <br>
         Oh, yeah <br>
        And oh, my love <br>
        I'm holding on forever <br>
        Reaching for the love that seems so far <br>
        So, I say a little prayer <br>
        And hope my dreams will take me there <br>
        Where the skies are blue <br>
        To see you once again, my love <br>
        Overseas, from coast to coast <br>
        To find a place I love the most <br>
        Where the fields are green <br>
        To see you once again <br>
        My love <br>
        I try to read, I go to work <br>
        I'm laughing with my friends <br>
        But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking, oh no <br>
        I wonder how, I wonder why <br>
        I wonder where they are <br>
        The days we had, the songs we sang together, oh, yeah <br>
        And oh, my love <br>
        I'm holding on forever <br>
        Reaching for the love that seems so far <br>
        So, I say a little prayer <br>
        And hope my dreams will take me there <br>
        Where the skies are blue <br>
        To see you l once again, my love <br>
        Overseas, from coast to coast <br>
        To find a place I love the most <br>
        Where the fields are green <br>
        To see you once again <br>
        To hold you in my arms <br>
        To promise you my love <br>
        To tell you from the heart <br>
        You're all I'm thinking of <br>
        I'm reaching for the love that seems so far <br>
        So, I say a little prayer <br>
        And hope my dreams will take me there <br>
        Where the skies are blue <br>
        To see you once again, my love <br>
        Overseas, from coast to coast <br>
        To find the place I love the most <br>
        Where the fields are green <br>
        To see you once again <br>
        (My love) <br>
        Say a little prayer (my sweet love) <br>
        Dreams will take me there <br>
        Where the skies are blue (woah, yeah) <br>
        To see you once again <br>
        Overseas, from coast to coast <br>
        To find the place I love the most <br>
        Where the fields are green <br>
        To see you once again <br>
        My love <br> <br> <br> <br>
